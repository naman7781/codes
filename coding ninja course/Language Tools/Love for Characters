    int n;
    cin >> n;
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    //char *p = new char[n];
    // for(int i = 0; i<n; i++)
    //     cin >> p[i];
    int c_a = 0, c_s = 0, c_p = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i<n; i++)
    {
        if(s[i]=='a')
            c_a++;
        if(s[i]=='s')
            c_s++;
        if(s[i]=='p')
            c_p++;
    }
    cout << c_a <<" "<<c_s<<" "<<c_p;
return 0;
